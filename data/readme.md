# `df210.csv` - Asset Index Data

## Description
This file contains asset index data for the years 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016.

## Notable Exclusions
- **2018**: This year was excluded because it does not have the sampling weight.
- **2019**: This dataset does not include data for 2019. It's important to note that the questionnaire for 2019 differs from the other years. Specifically, it contains a subset of the questions from other years. As a result, the value returned from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for 2019 will also be different.

## Additional Information
Another version of the file may include data for 2019. Not yet included!
