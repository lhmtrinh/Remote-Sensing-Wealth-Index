df210.csv contains asset index data for 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016. 
The reason 2018 is not included is because 2018 does not have sampling weight. 
Also, another version of the file should include 2019. However, the questionaire for 2019 is different from other years, in the meaning that it is a subset of questions of other years. Hence, the value returned from PCA will also be different.
